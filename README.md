Hello,

I am new to programming and are putting the theory into practice.

Within this simple programme I created a Matplotlib Line chart displaying the EUR and USD to GBP between June 2022 to June 2023.

I have included a Microsoft Excel file with the data.  The original data set can be found at

Thank you.

Paul
